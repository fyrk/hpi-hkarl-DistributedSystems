 

* Basic structure 
    
*** Case study: World Wide Web – Basic architecture
 Basic architectures very simple
 - Web servers provide “web pages”
 - Identified by a “Uniform Resource Locator” (URL)
 - Pages formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
 - Web browsers request pages from servers
 - Server and browser communicate using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
 - 
*** The request/reply protocol: HTTP
 HTTP essentially a simple protocol
 - Requests
 - GET: Obtain content of URL of interest
 - 
 - 
 - 
 - HEAD: Similar to GET, but only provide meta data, not actual content 
 - POST: Provide URL corresponding to a program that can accept the data provided in the POST message 
 - PUT: Provide URL where the data provided in the PUT message should be stored 
 - … plus various others (DELTE, OPTIONS, TRACE)
 - 
 - Reply: Return page, plus error code, status, … 
 - REDIRECT: Important example, error code telling the browser to use the returned URL instead 
*** Requests: Static and dynamic content, state 
 GET requests can refer to a static web page (simply delivered by the server) or to execution of a program 
 - Server might make simple modifications to a page during delivery, triggered e.g. by “server side include” instructions
 - Server might also compute the request page on the fly, depending on parameters in the request 
 - Typical: “?” to signal that, key=value pairs separated by “&”
 - GET http://somewhere.bla.net/some/path/somewhere?key=skjdfhskjdhf&param1=sdjhfgdsf&param2=sdhhjsd 
 - Convention: GET does not alter state 
 - 
 - POST requests refer to a program execution 
 - POST provides parameters to the program
 - Parameters usually depend on user input 
 - Typically, POST will alter state 
 - Output of the program is delivered back to the client and rendered as the page



* Server-side programmability  

*** From static pages to dynamic content 

- Splitting up the web server into actual server, web framework 
- Example: simple nginx/django setup 


*** Web frameworks 
 48
*** Web frameworks – Example: Django (python) 
 49
*** Running Web applications in Web servers
 50
*** Running Web applications in Web servers
 51
*** Example setup: django, nginx, uwsgi  






*** Alternative examples

- Tomcat, Ruby on Rails, ... 

* Client-side programmability 

*** Issue: latency for complex interactions 

*** Applications in the WWW – State & cookies 
 By design, HTTP is stateless, so are Web servers
 - How to build applications in such an environment? 
 - 
 - How to still provide some statefulness in WWW context? 
 - How to eat your cake and have it? Cookies! 
 - 
 - Cookie: Text string, sent by server to client, stored by browser 
 - Main standards: RFC 2109, RFC 2965 
 - Returned by browser to server with any request to a server matching the domain stated in the cookie (and where the path matches as well)
 - Useful to identify users, store application state AT CLIENT, … 
 - Can encode many different types of information 
 - Alternatives to store state: complex URLs, dynamically updated and returned 
 - 
 - Simple, sometimes useful, yet problematic 
 - Malicious cookie theft, inconsistencies between server/browser, … 
*** Applications in the WWW – AJAX 
 Interactive web applications easy in principle
 - Changes result in POST messages, new Web page is returned
 - Problem: Latency, bandwidth to transmit entire new page (after each user interaction!) limits “interactive feel” 
 - Approach: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML – AJAX

*** AJAX: Basic ideas 
 41
*** AJAX example
 42
*** AJAX: XMLHttpRequest 
 43
*** AJAX: Relevant libraries 
 44
*** DOM manipulation 

*** General idea: Event-based programming 

- Asynchronous requests! 
- Event loops, call backs 
- Promises, futures, ? 



*** Example Anuglar.JS 
*** Model/view controller abstraction 
*** Other example:  WebSocket

- not sure this is so important ? 



*** TODO Suitable server: Torndao 
- http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/ 
- Or introduce in the server section? 


* Interfacing clients and servers: REST  

*** A variation on the web services theme: REST
 Web services can use complex interfaces 
 - Specified with SOAP, WSDL
 - Allow complex interaction relationships between users and providers of such services
 - 
 - Beauty in simplicity?
 - Use a very restricted interface set: create, read, update, delete (CRUD)
 - Sounds like GET, PUT, DELETE, POST ? 
 - Concentrate on the manipulation of data through such a simple interface
 - When accessing a data resource, the entire resource is provided (i.e., web page is downloaded) and can then be locally manipulated instead of complex interface operations 
 - 
 -  ! Realized in Representational state transfer (REST)
 - Fielding, Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, 2000

#+BEGIN_SRC  html

  <form action="form_handler.php" method=”POST">
    User Name: <input name="user" type="text" />
   <input type="submit"value="Submit" />
  </form>

#+END_SRC

 No DELETE, PUT, 
 - ... supported!
*** RESTful: Interface descriptions?

*** Swagger examples 

*** Swagger examples 

*** Examples
 Several popular sites provide Web services 
 - Yahoo, google, ebay, Amazon, … 
 - Example: Access to Google’s Map api 
 - You’ll need: 
 - a programming language that can curl a URL 
 - Interpret the resulting JSON
 - 
 import requests
 - import json
 - 
 - r = requests.get(“https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/
 - geocode/json?address=Warbugrstr. 100, Paderborn")
 - 
 - print json.dumps(r.json(), indent=4)

*** TODO Case study: Reactive Systems  

- Check, does this really belong here? 

*** Reactive Systems – “Manifesto”
 129
*** Typesafe reactive platform 
 130
 Programs, in Java or Scala, 
 - running on JVM 
 Data engine 
 Message-driven 
 - middleware, based on actors
 Web framework 
*** Typesafe: Actors programming model 
 131
*** Typesafe: ConductR – Cluster runtime 
 132


*** Example: Snort as microservice or NFV 

- Not sure there is time for that?

* What this class is all about 

*** Distributed system (DS)?

 - A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system.
 - 							-- A. S. Tannenbaum
 - 
 - A distributed computing system consists of multiple autonomous processors that do not share primary memory but cooperate by sending messages over a communication network.
 - 						-- Henri Bal
 - 
 - A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer which you didn‘t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.
 - 						-- Leslie Lamport
*** Crucial aspects of a distributed system

 - Autonomy
 - A distributed system consists of autonomous, independent entities (but usually cooperative ones, not antagonistic ones)
 - Each individual entity is – typically – a full-fledged, operational system of its own 
 - 
 - Transparency 
 - The fact that the distributed system is indeed a conglomerate of different (simpler) systems is of no interest and should be of no concern to the user 
 - 
 - How to achieve this? 
*** Topics of “Distributed Systems”
 Even assuming many devices can communicate, this is not enough to turn them into a system
 - This class is not about communication as such, 
 - but about how communicating devices can be turned into a useful system
 - It combines 
 - Theoretical/fundamental aspects
 - Practical issues, real-world systems, programming 
 - And tries to explain how and why theoretical aspects are necessary to build systems  
 - Considered examples (some of…) 
 - Platforms/middleware: .NET & Web services, Java-based
 - Systems/case studies: WWW, file systems, Mail, VoIP/SIP, CDN
*** Non-Topics of “Distributed Systems”
 This class is not about 
 - Communication protocols – it helps to know the material of the lecture “Rechnernetze” (Computer networks) 
 - Distributed algorithms – treated where necessary, but not in focus
 - Parallel computing (hardware or software) – treated occasionally in passing
 - Programming 
*** Overview
 Introduction 
 - Basic Interaction Patterns
 - Advanced Interaction Patterns
 - 
 - Time in distributed systems – Logical and real
 - Various distributed algorithms
 - Replication and consistency
 - 
 - Some case studies 



* Organization, exam, material

*** Homework assignments
 Exercises as “traditional” assignments 
 - This lecture will also include some practical exercises 
 - Programming
 - (We used to do VMWare-based actual installations, but nobody was interested ) 
 - 
 - Assignments will be discussed in “Tafelübung”; they will not be graded or used for bonus points, … 
*** Project!
*** Exam

 - Written exam
 - 
 - Date and time: 
 - First instance: ??? (time and location: unknown) 
 - Second instance: ?? 
 - 
 - Material of both lecture and exercises is relevant for the exam
*** Material

 - There will be no script 
 - 
 - Slides will be available on the class web page prior to lecture 
 - 
 - You should have a look at at least one of the recommended textbooks 
*** Textbooks

- no ideal textbook exsits 
- Good, but old fashioned: Tanenbaum, colouris
- Lot's of material online 
- See also Mendeley group 

* TODO An example for this class 

- Slides from FAD, ATOS scenario

** Clouds 

*** Basic models 

- I/P/SaaS
- Function as a service or Framework as a Service
  - Example: AWS Lambda ; https://webtask.io; https://www.iron.io
- Serverless architectures

**** Cloud computing – “is a service” 
  75
**** Taxonomy of cloud computing 
  76
  Rimal, Choi, Lumb, A Taxonomy and Survey of Cloud Computing Systems, 2009
  Licencing model 
  - Payment systems 
  - Standardization, in particular to protect against vendor lock-in 
  - Formal service level agreements (SLA)? 
  Hoefer, Karagiannis, Taxonomy of cloud computing, 2012 
**** IaaS

**** PaaS, SaaS 

**** Open Source Examples 
  Important missing example: OpenStack
**** A taxonomy tree (Example: Google Apps)  
  Hoefer, Karagiannis, Taxonomy of cloud computing, 2012 


*** Private clouds: OpenStack 

  - OpenStack, the whole family
    - Neutron
    - Heat
    - ... ?

      
**** OpenStack: THE cloud stack, currently

**** OpenStack: core and optional projects 
  82
**** OpenStack: Conceptual architecture (late 2015 release)
  http://docs.openstack.org/liberty/install-guide-obs/common/get_started_conceptual_architecture.html
  Non-trivial system to set up!
**** Using OpenStack

*** Containter-based approach: Kubernetes 

- Basics 
- Autoscaling (and service discovery) 

*** Main examples for public clouds , APIs 

- AWS, block storage, etc.  
- Google Cloud
- Rackspace 
- ??? 

*** Dealing with heterogeneity 

- Terraform 
- Libcloud https://libcloud.apache.org 

*** Cluster Management 

- Apache Mesos 
- Cluster Apache Helix https://helix.apache.org
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42154354/when-to-use-apache-helix-and-when-to-use-apache-mesos
  - https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/02/building-venice-with-apache-helix
    - Replciated state management, data partition. Fault tolerance. Probably does not fit in this category???

* Overview 
  
*** Goals of this chapter 

- Define some common ground on terminology, models
  - System, data exchange
- Some messaging APIs
  - Sockets, more convenient ones 
- Then: structure distributed systems as client/server systems 
- Some simple example code 

*** Intended outcome 

You should be able to understand 
- the rationale for a client/server structure 
- name its pros and cons 
- write simple example code 


* Background: System model 

** Nodes and data exchange 

*** System models and system aspects 

Generic modeling issues \cite[Ch.~2]{Coulouris:DistributedSystems:2011}
 - Node model (hardware and software) 
 - Data exchange paradigm
 - Behaviour in time 
 - Fault assumptions
 - Security assumptions 


*** Node model 

- Each *node* in a distributed system acts on its own 
  - Autonomy! 
  - Nodes = computer, process, processor, \ldots 
- Can imply
  - Node is full-fledged system, with own operating system, etc.
  - Part of a coordinated system (e.g., multiprocessor)
    - Not focus here! 



*** Data exchange based on messages

- Data exchange based on messages
  - Nodes communicating by messages
- Message: a well-delimited amount of data

** Message exchange  

*** Sending and receiving

- Message: 
  - Originating from (usually a single) sender 
  - Destined to (usually a single) receiver 
  - A *packet*
- Alternative notion: A *stream of data*
  - Continuous flow of data, no natural boundaries 
  - From sender to receiver 
- Communication (either packet or stream) can be *unidirectional* or *bidirectional*

*** Properties 

Properties of message delivery: 

- Messages lost?
- Modified in transit?
- In-order?
- Time-bounded?
- Changes to originator? 

*** Sending and receiving: Operations 

We usually have some operations like: 

- ~send~
  - ~send(msg_buffer, destination)~
- ~receive~
  - ~receive(msg_buffer, meta_data)~
  - ~meta_data~ might contain originator, length, \ldots
    - Both input and output value! 
- Both with relevant return values (error codes, etc.) 

*** Synchronicity of operations 

~send~, ~receive~ are OS operations, might block a running process
(~man send~) 

- ~send~ operation
  - (Strictly) blocking, version 1: Wait until message has been *delivered*
    - Unusual 
  - Blocking, version 2: Wait until the message has been sent on its way
    - At least: *copied* into an OS buffer
    - After return, buffer can be reused
    - Return does not state anything about delivery
    - Only stalls process for longer time if OS is out of buffer space 
  - (Strictly) non-blocking: Prepare OS for sending of message
    - Buffer still occupied by message; cannot be reused immediately
    - Needs separate information that buffer is cleared
    - Unusual  


*** Synchronicity of operations 


- ~receive~ operation (~man recvfrom~, ~man recvmsg~)
  - Blocking: Wait until a message has arrived (process blocked)
    - Process resumes (sometime) after message arrives 
    - Possibly, of specified properties: desired originator, maximum
      length, \ldots
    - Often, no guarantee on minimum length!
  - Nonblocking (~man fcntl~, ~O_NONBLOCK~): Check whether message is available
    - Copy into process buffer if yes
    - Corresponding return value if no
    - Does never block process for longer time 

*** Synchronicity of operations: combinations 

- All combinations possible
- Highly depends on operating system, API in use 
- Common combination:
  - Blocking (v2) ~send~, blocking ~receive~ 

- Other combinations: Homework! 

*** Communication participants
 Combinations of sender and receiver
 - Unicast: 1 sender, 1 receiver
 - Broadcast: 1 sender, all known destinations are receivers
 - Multicast: 1 sender, selected group of receivers
 - Convergecast: multiple senders, data is somehow combined to arrive only at a single receiver


** Shared memory 

*** Data exchange based on shared memory 

- Nodes do not communicate directly, but via a joint memory 
- Behavior of the memory? 
  - Central memory? Distributed memory?
  - Semantics of the memory, e.g. at simultaneous accesses? 
  - What does /simultaneous/ mean? 


#+CAPTION: Shared memory structure
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\linewidth
#+NAME: fig:shared_memory
[[./figures/shared_memory.pdf]]


*** Shared memory: PRAM model 

Common model: *Parallel* Random Access Machine \cite{Karp:1988:SPA:894803}

- Generalizes ordinary Random Access Machine
- Multiple processes issue ~LOAD~ and ~STORE~ operations
  - Operands: Memory address, register 
- In strict synchrony: *lock-step model*  
- Compare: \url{http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tvrdik/2/html/Section2.html}
  (and many other online resources) 

*** PRAM: Multiple concurrent reads 

Situation: Multiple processors want to *read* the same address at the 
same time 


#+BEAMER: \pause


- Option 1: That's fine; allow to proceed; all get same value
  - Allow *concurrent reads* (CR) 
- Option 2: Forbid even that; terminate program with error
  - Insist on *exclusive reads* (ER) 

*** PRAM: Multiple concurrent writes 

Situation: Multiple processors want to *write*  the same address at the 
same time 


#+BEAMER: \pause


- Option 1: That's dangerous; terminate program with error
  - Insist on *exclusive writes* (EW)
- Option 2: That's ok if they all write the same value; otherwise,
  error
  - *COMMON concurrent write (CW)*
- Option 3: That's ok as long as we have some priority among the
  processors; highest priority wins
  - *PRIORITY concurrent write*
- Option 4: I don't care, just write any one of the intended values
  - *ARBITRARY concurrent write* 


*** PRAM: Combinations 

- All combinations of ER/CR with EW/variants of CW are possible
- /Weaker/ models like EREW closer to reality, but more difficult to
  program
- /Stronger/ models like CRCW: vice versa


#+BEAMER: \pause

- But: On $p$ processors, weakest model can simulate strongest model
  with $O(\log p)$ slowdown and $p$ times memory 


*** PRAM algorithm: Check if value is present in memory 

- $p$ processors, $n$ memory cells, processor $P_0$ has value $x$
- $P_0$ wants to know whether $x$ occurs in at least one of the $n$
  cells 


*** EREW-PRAM: Check if value is present in memory 

- $P_0$ broadcasts $x$ to other processors: *binary broadcast*
  - Cost: $O(\log p)$
- All processors perform local search on $n/p$ items
  - Cost: $n/p$
- All processors perform *parallel reduction*
  - Cost: $n/p$
- Total cost: $O(\log p) + n/p$


*** Other PRAMs: Check if value is present in memory 

- What can be simplified on a CREW PRAM, a COMMON-CRCW PRAM? 

#+BEAMER: \pause
- CREW: No binary broadcast needed; $O(1)$
- COMMON-CRCW: No parallel reduction needed as well: processors that
  found $x$ just write ~True~ into $P_0$ 

** Timing models 

*** Time in distributed systems? 

- PRAM model made a *strong* assumption: lock-step model for execution
- This is ok for a theoretic model like PRAMs
- It is not realizable in a real system

#+BEAMER: \pause

- What can we say about timing behaviour?
- Formalized in *timing models* 

*** Timing models 

In general: assumptions about the set of points in time where events
are allowed to occur

**** Timing models for processing 

- Are all nodes equally fast? Varying speed? 

**** Timing models for communication 

- Do all message exchanges take equally long?
  - All packets same (maximum?) size?
- When is it allowed to send data?


*** Ends of a spectrum 


**** Synchronous model 

- Everything takes *exactly* one time unit: processing, communication
- Everything happens *exactly* at the same time 
- PRAM's lock-step model
- Unrealistic  

**** Asynchronous model 

- Nothing is assumed: Everything can take arbitrarily long
  - E.g., no upper bound on how long it takes a packet from A to B 

*** In between? 

- Options in between these extremes? 
  - Restrict maximum speed difference
  - Give access to approximately synchronized clock
    - With some error compared to *real* time, but bounded
  - Assume upper bounds on some actions, e.g., packet delivery
    - If it did not arrive with $T$ time, consider it lost
      $\rightarrow$ Timeout! 
    
  


** Faults models 

*** Fault models 

- Things go wrong!
  - Processors fail, messages are lost, \ldots
  - By accident or maliciously 
- Different techniques needed to handle different faults
- Different metrics needed to describe 
- We come back to that in Chapter 4 


* Background: Some messaging APIs

** Sockets 

*** API for communication: Sockets 
 Suitable for both messages and streams 
 - Can express all synchronicity combinations
 - Based on analogy: Communication with a remote partner is akin to reading from/writing to a file 
 - For details see 
   - VL KMS, VL Rechnernetze 
   - Many online resources on the topic,
     e.g. http://jan.newmarch.name/distjava/socket/lecture.html ;
     \url{https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_sockets/index.htm} 
   - Stevens, Unix Network Programming
     \cite{Stevens:UnixNetworkProgramming}, \cite{9780131411555} -- old but still useful

*** Plain sockets -- good? 

- Complex API, owing to its age 
- But full control over all details 
- Option: retain the basic interaction structure, but wrap it in nicer
  API  

** Example: 0mq

*** Nicer API: 0mq (http://zeromq.org)

ØMQ (also known as ZeroMQ, 0MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fan-out, pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems. ØMQ is from iMatix and is LGPLv3 open source.



*** Nicer API: 0mq (http://zeromq.org)  

- Clean-up the socket interface 
- Make both simple sockets and more abstract patterns (see below)
  available in many languages
- Simple usage 
- Be *fast* and efficient 

- (BTW: nanomsg http://nanomsg.org can be regarded successor to 0mq)

*** Sockets in C -- good? 

- Even with 0mq (or similar), sockets stay cumbersome 
  - Advantage: Full, detailed control
  - E.g., ~select()~ call -- see homework 
- Alternatives?
  - Change programming language? Wrap sockets in an object-oriented
    concept?
  - Change paradigm? Raise abstraction level?

*** Sockets in OO languages 

- No substantial simplification over plain code 
  - But modern languages do help 


#+BEAMER: \pause

- Issue: Does communication depend on programming language?
- Can programs in different languages talk to each other? 


#+BEAMER: \pause
- Expectation:
  - Should be possible for simple data types (integers, strings,
    \ldots)
  - Objects of classes? Challenging! 


** Heterogeneity 

*** Language/architecture independence: Issue 

- Different programming languages, different computer architectures
  lay out data differently
  - Byte order for integers
  - Strings: Length byte, null-terminated, \ldots?
  - Objects: large variety in memory layout, semantics 


#+BEAMER: \pause

- In general, we cannot assume but parts are written using the same
  language!

- We need to translate between different representations 

*** Serialization 

- We need to *serialize* programming-language/architecture internal
  representation into a *neutral* representation 
  - Translating back and forth between internal and neutral
    representation 
  - Only neutral representation is sent -- the so-called *wire format*


#+BEAMER: \pause

- Why an intermediate neutral representation?
  - Alternative: $O(n^2)$ translations necessary 


#+BEAMER: \pause
- Different names: serialization, pack/unpack, marshalling 

*** 0mq: Exchanging data across languages 

- Uses a simple and very efficient wire format 
- No explicit support for translation between complex language
  artefacts
  - Simple things like strings work 


*** Wire transfer approaches 

- Some candidates 
  - Abstract Syntax Notation.1 (ASN.1 )-- ISO/OSI layer 6;
    self-descriptive \cite{itut:applic_asn.1}
  - XML \url{http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/02-06-51}
  - OMG CDR
  - JSON
- Issues
  - Cumbersome, talkative, memory and CPU-intensive 

*** Wire transfer approaches -- modern candidates 

- Google protobuf -- https://github.com/google/protobuf

- Apache Thrift -- http://thrift.apache.org 

- Fast Buffers --
  http://www.eprosima.com/index.php/products-all/eprosima-fast-buffers 

- Message Pack -- https://msgpack.org

  - Lot's of language bindings; used by redis, Pinterest, ... 

- Cap'n Proto -- https://capnproto.org

  - From one of the developers of Google Protobuf 

- FlatBuffers -- https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/ 


*** Core idea: Put type information into message 

- When transferring an integer, explicitly say it is an integer!
- For a string: say how long
- For a map: where are keys and values

*** How to know what to translate into wire format? 

- Option 1: Language has enough type information at run-time
  - Use that! 

#+BEAMER: \pause

- Option 2: It does not! :-(
  - Need additional information about the structure of a piece of data
    to be translated
  - Option 2.1: Provide it explicitly in the code, by appropriate
    function calls
  - Option 2.2: Provide it separately, explicit annotation; separate
    "mini-language"  
    - Comes by different names: Schema Language, Interface Definition
      Language, Thrift file, ...
    - Generate code for target language from there 


*** Option 1: Translate based on run-time type information 

- Example: msgpack

*** Option 2.1: Explicit annotation in source code 

- When creating a wire transfer representation, add data *and type* to

*** Option 2.2: Separate specification of types 

- Separate from the program code: describe data structure 
- Translate that into code that packs, unpacks actual data at runtime 
- For each data type that needs to be transmitted!

*** Option 2.2: Example google Protocol Buffers 

- Protocol Buffers provides

  - Format to describe data structures in ~.proto~ files

  - Generate sender and receiver code from that -- a *compiler* for
    ~.proto~ files 

  - For different target languages (Java, C++, Go, Python, C#) 

  - Some runtime library support 

*** Protocol Buffers: proto example 

Examples follow https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial

#+BEGIN_SRC python 
message Person {
  required string name = 1;
  required int32 id = 2;
  optional string email = 3;
}

* Client/server, basic structure 


** Basics  of client/server 
*** From sockets to structured distributed programs

With sockets (or similar APIs), arbitrary data exchange relationships between different parts of a distributed system can be formulated 
 -  $\rightarrow$  ``Spaghetti passing'' akin to goto-induced Spaghetti code
 - Put some structure even in distributed applications
 

First idea: asymmetric roles between 
 - A requester of some sort of processing/data
 - A provider of this processing/data

#+BEAMER: \pause

$\rightarrow$ *Client/server paradigm*


*** Client/Server Paradigm

 - Basic assumption: Some computers are more equal than others!
   - Some computers are connected to a printer, some not
   - Some computers have little disk capacity, some a lot 
 - Goal: share the resources of such special computers
 - Second goal: make them available to “anybody”
   - *Access* to these resources can be regarded as a *service*
   - Print a file on my printer, store some files on your big hard
     disk
 - Terminology 
   - Processes providing such services are called *servers*
   - Processes accessing these services are *clients*





*** Client/server interact via request/reply messages

 - Depends on the task that is to be performed

** Some structural aspects 
*** Execution structures of servers

 Servers can execute repeated requests (from same or different clients)
 - One after the other $\rightarrow$ potentially sub-optimal performance
 - Concurrently, by dynamically creating a server thread/process for
   each incoming request 
 - Concurrently, by assigning incoming requests to one out of a pool
   of threads/processes 

*** Execution structure: Server activation 

When is server process/thread started?
 - Once, at system startup, and remains active (*persistent server*)
 - Once, at first invocation of requested service, remains active  
 - Both: dedicated for a given service type or can serve different service types 
 - Per request – started at request arrival, terminates afterwards 


*** Execution structure: Server activation, practically  

- Persistent server
  - In bootup process, e.g.: upstart, ~/etc/init.d/~, ... 
- At first invocation, via a *super server daemon* 
  - ~inet.d~ (deprecated), ~xinet.d~, ~launchd~, ...
  - Tying request to service: Typically via port number; no actual
    *service naming* scheme in Internet architecture as such 

*** Execution structure: Server activation, example xinit.d 

Some features: 

- Allows access control
- Time-based availability of servers
- Maximum number of instances 
- Accessible via UDP or TCP 

- See ~man xinetd.conf~ 



*** Series of requests: Stateful/stateless servers

A series of requests might be related to each other
 - Server might know of this connection and store relevant state to
   relate successive requests to each other: *stateful server*
   - Requests must identify request sequence they belong to
 - Server might not care, treat each request as if it were an isolated
   one: *stateless server*
   - Requests must carry all necessary information all the time
   - Can be substantially larger than just sequence identifier 

*** Stateful/stateless: Examples 

 - Cookies
   - Versatile, more in HTTP chapter 
 - Server provides access to a file
   - Stateful server: Stores the position in the file where last read
     attempt took place, continues to read from this position at the
     following request
   - Stateless server: Each request must specify the position onwards
     from which to read
     - E.g., Network File System
 - Remote editing (like Google docs or similar) 

*** How to find server? 

- Open issue: How does client know which server to talk to? 

#+BEAMER: \pause

- Options:
  - Hard-coded IP/port 
  - Hard-coded name + port 
    - Needs *name resolution*, like DNS
  - /Service name/ somehow specified
    - Needs name resolution, provides IP *and* port
    - What if we do not run on top of IP? 

- More details later



*** Name resolution       

- Maps from one name space to another 
- Typical operations
  - Make an entry: *bind*, *register*, ...
  - Look up and entry 
- Many examples
  - DNS, Peer-to-peer systems,

#+BEAMER: \pause

  - Broadcasting (like ARP), without explicit registration step 

*** Client/Server Evaluation
  Advantages
  - Simple architecture, clear assignment of responsibilities
  - Simple programming paradigm: accessing a service is well known from sequential programming -– call a function!
    - Syntactically, it does not look like it yet 
  - Relatively simple to control: one process provides a given service

  Disadvantages
  - Server can become performance bottleneck
  - Server can be far away, long latency for services
  - A service fails if the single server fails -– /single point of failure/
  - How to find a server for a given service in the first place?
  - Resources of non-servers might be wasted (e.g., disk space)



** Request/reply  

*** Request/reply protocol in more detail

Request/reply is seemingly trivial
 - But what about failures?
 - Of communication (lost messages)? Client or server crash?
 - Possible problems and remedies

*** Recall: Simple request/reply protocol 
****                                                        :B_columns:BMCOL:

 \end{tikzpicture}
 #+END_LaTeX

*** What if no reply received? 

Issue 1: doOperation does not receive reply
 - Detected by: Timeout in client 
 - Possible causes: request or reply lost, server has crashed
 - Action:
   - Resend the request message
   - Count number of attempts and abort if server crash is suspected


#+BEAMER: \pause

Easy!  But what if \ldots 



*** Multiple copies of a request 

Issue 2: same request arrives multiple times
 - Caused by retransmissions (needed to cure Issue 1) 
 - Detected by: Server repeatedly receives the same message identifier
   from the same client
   - Prerequisite: Message IDs in request message, server stores message identifiers
   - Possible cause: Timeouts in client (owing to lost reply message
     or slow server), request message duplicated in the network

Challenge: Execute operation *exactly once* per request 

*** Multiple copies of a request -- Actions: 

Actions: 
   - Discard the additional request (do not execute more than once)
   - Reply (to original request) not yet sent: no further action necessary
   - Reply (to original request) already sent: Resend the reply to this request 
     - If server can reexecute the operation to obtain the same result
       again (including all sideeffects! – idempotent operations):
       - Do so, send reply again 
     - If not: Server needs a history of message identifiers and replies 
     - (History can be cleared by interpreting a client’s request n+1 as acknowledgement for the request n – but timeout still necessary)

** Summary 

*** Summary: A simple two-tier model 

- Client/server is a simple model to structure distributed applications
- So far, just two *tiers* considered
